# What is highres-cortex?

This is a collection of software designed to process high-resolution magnetic resonance images of the cerebral cortex.

If you use this work in an academic publication, **please cite** the relevant references, as listed in [`doc/references.bib`](doc/references.bib).


# Layout

The source is organized in three components, from high-level to low-level:

  - Scripts to do the high-level processing, under [`scripts/`](scripts/).
  - A Python package, under [`python/highres-cortex/`](python/highres-cortex/).
  - A library and compiled executables, written in C++, under [`src`](src/).


# Compiling

This package is compiled using the BrainVISA compilation system, which is an extension to CMake. Follow the [instructions at brainvisa.info](http://brainvisa.info/repository.html#use_brainvisa_sources) to clone the source tree. You need to include two lines in `bv_maker.cfg` in order to clone and compile `highres-cortex`. Here is a minimal `bv_maker.cfg`:

    [ source $HOME/brainvisa/source/trunk ]
      anatomist trunk
      git https://github.com/neurospin/highres-cortex.git master highres-cortex

    [ build $HOME/brainvisa/build/trunk ]
      anatomist trunk $HOME/brainvisa/source/trunk
      + $HOME/brainvisa/source/trunk/highres-cortex


# Dependencies

  - AIMS version 4.5 or later (in developement at the time of this writing, use the `trunk` version from SVN). This image processing library is distributed as part of [BrainVISA](http://brainvisa.info/).
  - [GSL (GNU Scientific Library)](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/).
  - [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) version 1.49 or later.
