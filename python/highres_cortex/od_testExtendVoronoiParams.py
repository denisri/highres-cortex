# this scripts compares results of heat calculation for several cases:
# the original is the heat calculated in the whole cortex
# these temperature values are compared to the heat calculated in some "cut out" region
# e.g. in Heschl gyrus and in Planum Temporale. 
# These cut-out regions were extended. The question is to find the required "extension size"
# to keep values in the ROI similar to those in the original volume.
# The maximal difference should not be > 1%.

# this function will take the original volume, the mask of ROIs, and a list of volumes that were
# created at various extensions.
# the maximal difference is calculated and reported.

# example how to run this file:
# python /volatile/od243208/brainvisa_sources/highres-cortex/python/highres_cortex/od_testExtendVoronoiParams.py -p lg140146 -d /neurospin/lnao/dysbrain/optimiseParmaters_ExtendVoronoi/ -s R
