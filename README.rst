This is a collection of software designed to process high-resolution magnetic resonance images of the cerebral cortex.

If you use this work in an academic publication, **please cite** the relevant references (see `<doc/references.bib>`_).


Layout
------

The source is organized in three components, from high-level to low-level:

- Scripts to do the high-level processing, under `<scripts/>`_.
- A Python package, under `<python/highres_cortex/>`_.
- A library and compiled executables, written in C++, under `<src/>`_.


Compiling
---------

This package is compiled using the BrainVISA_ compilation system, which is an extension to CMake_. Follow the instructions at http://brainvisa.info/repository.html#use_brainvisa_sources to clone the source tree. You need to include two lines in ``bv_maker.cfg`` in order to clone and compile ``highres-cortex``. Here is a minimal ``bv_maker.cfg``::

    [ source $HOME/brainvisa/source/trunk ]
      + anatomist trunk
      git https://github.com/neurospin/highres-cortex.git master highres-cortex

    [ build $HOME/brainvisa/build/trunk ]
      anatomist trunk $HOME/brainvisa/source/trunk
      + $HOME/brainvisa/source/trunk/highres-cortex


Dependencies
------------

- AIMS version 4.5 or later (in development at the time of this writing, use the ``trunk`` version from SVN). This image processing library is distributed as part of BrainVISA_.
- The ``VipHomotopic`` tool from the Morphologist image segmentation pipeline, distributed as part of BrainVISA_.
- GSL_ (GNU Scientific Library).
- Boost_ version 1.49 or later.
- CMake_ version 2.6 or later, with its extension ``brainvisa-cmake`` (distributed with BrainVISA_).
- Python_ version 2.6 or later.
